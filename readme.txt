The NIVO slider light plugin includes the JQuery NIVO Slider into your wordpress blog. It does not touch any other gallerys.

== Description ==

The NIVO slider can be used to make a simple gallery in your articles. It does not modify any other images.

Have a look at [the demos](http://nivo.dev7studios.com/demos/) and at the [usage guide](http://nivo.dev7studios.com/).

Just write

`&lt;div class="nivoslider"&gt;
	&lt;img src="/uploads/slide1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://dev7studios.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/uploads/slide2.jpg" alt="" title="#htmlcaption" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;img src="/uploads/slide3.jpg" alt="" title="This is an example of a caption" /&gt;
	&lt;img src="/uploads/slide4.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`

Be sure that all images have the same size. Feel free to edit the plugin's source now as described in the usage guide.
